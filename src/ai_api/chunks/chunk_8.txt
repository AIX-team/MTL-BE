fun presentation [00:20:25] and as you can see, [00:20:26] it was served piping hot [00:20:28] and the oysters are not small. [00:20:51] My favorite was easily the yakitori. [00:20:54] Hot. [00:20:54] Flavorful. Delicious. [00:20:57] If you come here, [00:20:57] I'd grab a bunch of these guys. [00:21:06] Next station is Kyoto.
